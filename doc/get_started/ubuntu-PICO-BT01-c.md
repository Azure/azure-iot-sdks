# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect PICO-BT01 device running Ubuntu with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   PICO-BT01 device.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   Install Ubuntu on your device, [device website](http://www.aaeon.com/en/p/pico-itx-boards-pico-bt01).

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

## 3.1 Build SDK and sample

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.

-   Install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C by issuing the following commands from the command line on your board:

    **Ubuntu**
	
        sudo apt-get update

        sudo apt-get install -y curl libcurl4-openssl-dev uuid-dev uuid g++ make cmake git unzip openjdk-7-jre
		
	***Note:*** *This setup process requires cmake version 2.8.12 or higher.* 
    
    *You can verify the current version installed in your environment using the  following command:*

        cmake --version

    *This library also requires gcc version 4.9 or higher. You can verify the current version installed in your environment by using the following command:*
    
        gcc --version 

    *For information about how to upgrade your version of gcc on Ubuntu 14.04, see <http://askubuntu.com/questions/466651/how-do-i-use-the-latest-gcc-4-9-on-ubuntu-14-04>.*

-   Download the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C to the board by issuing the following command on the board::

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks.git

-   Edit the following file using any text editor of your choice:

    **For AMQP protocol:**

        azure-iot-sdks/c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_amqp/iothub_client_sample_amqp.c

-   Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Prerequisites) and save the changes.

-   Build the SDK using following command.

        sudo ./azure-iot-sdks/c/build_all/linux/build.sh

## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Run the sample by issuing following command:

    **For AMQP protocol:** Run sample *iothub\_client\_sample\_amqp*

        ~/cmake/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_amqp/linux/iothub_client_sample_amqp

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.

# Tips

- If you just want to build the serializer samples, run the following commands:

  ```
  cd ./c/serializer/build/linux
  make -f makefile.linux all
  ```
