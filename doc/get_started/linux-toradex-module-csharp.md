# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to how to setup Mono and run the **Device Client HTTPS Sample** application on a Toradex module with Linux. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   [Build DeviceClientHttpsSample C# sample application][run_sample_on_desktop_windows]
-   Ensure the module is flashed with [Toradex V2.5 Linux image or newer][toradex_image_update].

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

1.  Insert the module into a compatible carrier board.  Power on the system and connect to the internet.

2.  Use the command line to install Mono and necessary dependencies:

    ```
    opkg update
    opkg install mono mono-dev ca-certificates
    ```

3.  Import trusted root certificates:

    ```
    mono /usr/lib/mono/4.5/mozroots.exe --import --sync
    ```

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

1.  Copy the the contents of the compiled **Device Client HTTPS Sample** application's **bin** directory to the module.

2.  Execute the application with Mono:

    ```
    mono DeviceClientHttpsSample.exe
    ```


3.   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the **Device Client HTTPS Sample** application and how to send cloud-to-device messages to the **Device Client HTTPS Sample** application.
