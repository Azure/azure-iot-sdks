# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect Samsung ARTIK device running Fedora 22 with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   Computer with Git client installed and access to the
    [azure-iot-sdks](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks) GitHub
    public repository.
-   Samsung ARTIK device to certify.
-   Download and install [DeviceExplorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/releases/download/2015-11-13/SetupDeviceExplorer.msi).
-   [Set up your IoT hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/doc/setup_iothub.md).
#### Create a device on IoT Hub
-   With your IoT hub configured and running in Azure, follow the instructions in **"Create Device"** section of [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md).
#### Write down device credentials
-   Make note of the Connection String for your device by following the instructions in **"Get device connection string or configuration data"** section of [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md).

# Step 2: Prepare your Device
After unboxing your Samsung ARTIK devices, please follow our Getting Started documentations at <https://developer.artik.io/documentation/getting-started-beta/> to power up your board, and set up the serial communication between your ARTIK device and your host computer.

ARTIK supports both Ethernet and WiFi. If you want to use WiFi on your ARTIK, please refer to <https://developer.artik.io/documentation/developer-guide/configuring-wifi-on-artik-10.html> to configure WiFi on your board.

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

<a name="Load"></a>
## 3.1 Build SDK and sample

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.

-   Install the prerequisite packages for the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C by issuing the following commands from the command line on your board:

        dnf check-update -y

        dnf install libcurl-devel openssl-devel libuuid-devel uuid-devel gcc-c++ make cmake git unzip java-1.7.0-openjdk

-   Download the Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C to the board by issuing the following command on the board::

        git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks.git

-   Edit the following file using any text editor of your choice:
  
    **For AMQP protocol:**

        azure-iot-sdks/c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_amqp/iothub_client_sample_amqp.c

    **For HTTPS protocol:**

        azure-iot-sdks/c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_http/iothub_client_sample_http.c

-   Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Step-1:-Prerequisites) and save the changes.

-   On the board, run the following command to build and install Apache Proton library:

        ./azure-iot-sdks/c/build_all/linux/build_proton.sh --install /usr
        chmod +x ./azure-iot-sdks/c/build_all/linux/build_paho.sh
        ./azure-iot-sdks/c/build_all/linux/build_paho.sh

-   Assuming everything went OK on the build_proton.sh, you can now build the SDK samples using the following command:

        ./azure-iot-sdks/c/build_all/linux/build.sh

## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

-   Run the sample by issuing following command:

    **For AMQP protocol:**

        ~/cmake/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_amqp/linux/iothub_client_sample_amqp

    **For HTTPS protocol:**

        ~/cmake/c/iothub\_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_http/linux/iothub_client_sample_http

-   On Windows, refer "Monitor device-to-cloud events" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) to see the data your device is sending.

-   If you are running other OS, please use the JavaScript tool [iot-hub explorer tool](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/tree/master/tools/iothub-explorer/doc)

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   On Windows, refer "Send cloud-to-device messages" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) for instructions on sending messages to device.

-   If you are running other OS, please use the JavaScript tool [iot-hub explorer tool](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/tree/master/tools/iothub-explorer/doc)

# Tips

- If you just want to build the serializer samples, run the following commands:

  ```
  cd ./c/serializer/build/linux
  make -f makefile.linux all
  ```
