# Step 2: Prepare your Device
##  Install Windows 8.1 Embedded Industry Enterprise on EL10
-   Create a bootable USB Drive. Please follow this guide on how to create a bootable drive (<https://www.microsoft.com/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool>).
-   Insert the bootable USB Drive from the previous step into your EL10. Turn on your EL10 device and press the **Delete** key.
-   Change the BIOS Boot option filter to **UEFI and Legacy**.

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

-   Download the [Azure IoT SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks) and save them to your local repository.
-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015.
-   Open the **iothub_csharp_client.sln** solution in the `csharp\device` folder in your local copy of the repository.
-   In Visual Studio, from Solution Explorer, navigate to the **samples** folder.
-   In the **DeviceClientAmqpSample** project, open the ***Program.cs*** file.
-   Locate the following code in the file:

        private const string DeviceConnectionString = "<replace>";
        
-   Replace `<replace>` with the connection string for your device.
-   In visual Studio, under Solution Explorer, right-click the **DeviceClientAmqpSample** project, click ***Debug &minus;&gt; Start new instance*** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.
-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application and how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
