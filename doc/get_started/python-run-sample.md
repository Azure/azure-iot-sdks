# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to run the **iothub_client_sample.py** Python sample application. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:
-   Computer with Git client installed and access to the
    [azure-iot-sdks](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks) GitHub public repository.
-   [Prepare your development environment][lnk-python-devbox-setup]
-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   Make sure desktop is ready as per instructions given on [Prepare your development environment][lnk-python-devbox-setup].

# Step 3: Run the sample

- Navigate to the folder **python/device/samples** in your local copy of the repository.

- Open the file **iothub_client_sample.py** in a text editor.

- Locate the following code in the file:

    ```
    connectionString = "[device connection string]"	
    ```

- Replace `[device connection string]` with the connection string for your device. Save the changes.

- Run the sample application using the following command:

    ```
	python iothub_client_sample.py
    ```

- The sample application will send messages to your IoT hub. The **iothub-explorer** utility will display the messages as your IoT hub receives them.

If you receive the error "ImportError: dynamic module does not define module export function (PyInit_iothub_client)" you may be running the samples with a different version of python than the iothub_client was build with. Following the [Prepare your development environment](#python-devbox-setup) to ensure the library is built with the desired python version

# Experimenting with various transport protocols
There is a command line switch to test each of the AMQP, HTTP and MQTT protocols. It is also possible to simply change the transport in the sample.

    ```
	python iothub_client_sample.py -p <mqtt|http|amqp>
    ```

# Debugging the samples (and/or your code)
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) provides an excellent environment to write and debug Python code:
