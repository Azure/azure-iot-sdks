# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to build and run the **simplesample_amqp** application on a desktop Linux platform. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Step-1-Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]
-   Download and install [DeviceExplorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/releases/download/2015-11-13/SetupDeviceExplorer.msi).
-   [Set up your IoT hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/doc/setup_iothub.md).

### Create a device on IoT Hub
-   With your IoT hub configured and running in Azure, follow the instructions in **"Create Device"** section of [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md).

### Write down device credentials
-   Make note of the Connection String for your device by following the instructions in **"Get device connection string or configuration data"** section of [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md).

  > Note: You can skip this step if you just want to build the sample application without running it.

# Step 2: Build and Run the sample

1.   Open the file **c/serializer/samples/simplesample_amqp/simplesample_amqp.c** in a text editor.

2.   Locate the following code in the file:
      ```
      static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";
      ```
3.   Replace "[device connection string]" with the device connection string you noted [earlier](#Step-1-Prerequisites). Save the changes.

4.   The section "Send events" in the document [How to use Device Explorer](../../tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) describes how to prepare the **DeviceExplorer** tool to receive device-to-cloud messages from the sample application.

5.   Save your changes and build the samples. To build your sample you can run the the build.sh script in the **c/build_all/linux** directory.

6.   Run the **~/cmake/serializer/samples/simplesample_amqp/simplesample_amqp** sample application.

7.   Use the **DeviceExplorer** utility to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the **simplesample_amqp** application.

8.   See "Send cloud-to-device messages" in the document [How to use Device Explorer for IoT Hub devices][device-explorer] for instructions on sending messages with the **DeviceExplorer** utility.
