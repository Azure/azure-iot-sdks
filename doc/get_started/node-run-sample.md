# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to build and run the **simple_sample_http.js** Node.js sample application. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:
-   Computer with Git client installed and access to the
    [azure-iot-sdks](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks) GitHub public repository.
-   [Prepare your development environment](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/csharp/device/doc/devbox_setup.md).
-   Download and install [DeviceExplorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/releases/download/2015-11-13/SetupDeviceExplorer.msi).
-   [Set up your IoT hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/doc/setup_iothub.md).

#### Create a device on IoT Hub
-   With your IoT hub configured and running in Azure, follow the instructions in **"Create Device"** section of [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md).

#### Write down device credentials
-   Make note of the Connection String for your device by following the instructions in **"Get device connection string or configuration data"** section of [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md).

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

-   Make sure desktop is ready as per instructions given on [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox].

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

- Get the following sample files from https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/node/device/samples
    - **package.json**
    - **simple_sample_device.js**

- Place the files in the folder of your choice on the target machine/device

- Open the file **simple_sample_device.js** in a text editor.

- Locate the following code in the file:

    ```
    var connectionString = '[IoT Device Connection String]';
    ```

- Replace `[IoT Device Connection String]` with the connection string for your device. Save the changes.

- From the shell or command prompt you used earlier to run the **iothub-explorer** utility, use the following command to receive device-to-cloud messages from the sample application (replace <device-id> with the ID you assigned your device earlier):

    ```
    node iothub-explorer.js "<iothub-connection-string>" monitor-events <device-id>
    ```

- Open a new shell or Node.js command prompt and navigate to the folder where you placed the sample files. Run the sample application using the following commands:

    ```
    npm install
    node simple_sample_device.js
    ```

- The sample application will send messages to your IoT hub, and the **iothub-explorer** utility will display the messages as your IoT hub receives them.

# Experimenting with various transport protocols
The same sample can be used to test AMQP, AMQP over Websockets, HTTP and MQTT. In order to change the transport, uncomment whichever you want to evaluate in the `require` calls on top of the sample code and pass it to the call to Client.fromConnectionString() when creating the client.

# Debugging the samples (and/or your code)
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) provides an excellent environment to write and debug Node.js code:
