# Getting started - running a Java sample application on Toradex modules with Linux

This "Getting Started" document shows you how to setup OpenJDK and run the sample Java device applications on a Toradex module with Linux.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you should:

- [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
- [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
- Use the [Azure IoT Java Application Development guides][java-dev-guides] to build example Java applications (e.g. send-event.java).
- Ensure the module is flashed with [Toradex V2.5 Linux image or newer][toradex_image_update].

## Configure OpenJDK on Toradex module with Linux

1.  Insert the module into a compatible carrier board.  Power on the system and connect to the internet.

2.  Use the command line to install OpenJDK and necessary dependencies:

    ```
    wget -P /etc/opkg/ http://feeds.toradex.com/extra/2.5/conf/all/extra.conf
    opkg update
    opkg install openjdk-7-jre openssl
    ```

3.  Import trusted root certificates:

    ```
    wget https://www.geotrust.com/resources/root_certificates/certificates/Equifax_Secure_Certificate_Authority.pem
	wget https://cacert.omniroot.com/bc2025.crt
	/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk/jre/bin/keytool -keystore ~/cacerts -importcert -alias equifaxsecureca -file Equifax_Secure_Certificate_Authority.pem
	/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk/jre/bin/keytool -keystore ~/cacerts -importcert -alias baltimorecybertrustca -file bc2025.crt
	/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk/jre/bin/keytool -list -keystore ~/cacerts
	```

## Run Java Sample Application

1. Transfer the compiled Java example applications to the device.

2. On the host machine, start a new instance of the [Device Explorer][device-explorer], select or create a new device, obtain and note the connection string for the device, and begin monitoring under the Data tab.

3. Back on the device, navigate to the folder containing the executable JAR file for the sample that you wish to run and run the samples as follows:

	The executable JAR file for sending event
	can be found at:

	```
	{IoT device SDK root}/java/device/samples/send-event/target/send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar
	```

	Navigate to the directory with the event sample. Run the sample using the following command:

	```
	java -jar ./send-event-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "{number of requests to send}" "{https or amqps}"
	```

	The executable JAR file for receiving messages can be found at:

	```
	{IoT device SDK root}/java/device/samples/handle-messages/target/handle-messages-{version}-with-deps.jar
	```

	Navigate to the directory with the messages sample. Run the sample using the following command:

	```
	java -jar ./handle-messages-{version}-with-deps.jar "{connection string}" "{https or amqps}"
	```

	Note that the double quotes around each argument are required, but the braces '{' and '}' should be removed.
