# Introduction

**About this document**

The following document describes the process of connecting an HoneyBee Repeater system to Azure IoT Hub.This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Step-1-Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:
-   Computer with a Git client installed so that you can access the azure-iot-sdks code on GitHub.
  - HoneyBee Repeater board.
  - Ubuntu x86 machine (for cross compiling) 
-   [Setup your IoT hub](../setup_iothub.md) 
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials](../manage_iot_hub.md)

<a name="Step-2-PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-  Connect the HoneyBee Repeater using the mini-USB cable.

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

## Setup the development environment

This section shows you how to set up a development environment for the Azure IoT device SDK for C on HoneyBee Repeater.

Install dependencies under root/sudo. 

``` 
apt-get install curl libcurl4-openssl-dev uuid-dev uuid g++ make cmake git unzip openjdk-7-jre libssl-dev libncurses-dev subversion gawk
```

- Clone this repository ([azure-iot-sdks](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks)) to the machine you are using, being sure to do a recursive clone (git clone --recursive <repo address>).
- Navigate to the folder **c/build_all/arduino** in your local copy of the repository.
- Run the `./setup.sh` script to install the OpenWRT SDK and prerequisites. By default, the SDK will be installed at **~/openwrt/sdk**
- (Optional) Enter 'Y' to build the Azure IoT SDK.

 <a name="build"/>
## Build the sample

- Open the file **c/serializer/samples/simplesample_http/simplesample_http.c** in a text editor (for example nano)
- Locate the following code in the file:
```
static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";
```
- Replace "[device connection string]" with the device connection string you noted [earlier](#beforebegin). Save the changes.
- Run the `./build.sh` script in the **c/build_all/arduino** directory.   

<a name="deploy"/>
## Deploy the sample

- Open a shell and navigate to the installed OpenWRT SDK folder. By default, it is **~/openwrt/sdk**.
- Transfer the sample executable.

OpenWRT Image:

```
scp ~/openwrt/sdk/build_dir/target-mips_r2_uClibc-0.9.33.2/azure-iot-sdks-1/serializer/samples/simplesample_http/simplesample_http root@OpenWrt:/tmp
```

LininoIO Image:

```
scp ~/openwrt/sdk/build_dir/target-mips_r2_uClibc-0.9.33.2/azure-iot-sdks-1/serializer/samples/simplesample_http/simplesample_http root@OpenWrt:/tmp
```

***Note: The uClibc version might be different on your setup and you might need to adjust the path accordingly.***

## Make sure the certificates are installed

On the HoneyBee Repeater device, install the ca-certificates package like below:

```
wget https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/packages/base/ca-certificates_20160104_all.ipk --no-check-certificate
opkg install ca-certificates_20160104_all.ipk
```
You might get an error message at this step(return code 127), but the certificates will be installed.

***Note: The certificate name mention above may change when newer version of certificate is released. If you get a 404 error while downloading the certificate file, please double check the CA certificate name under the base path [here](https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/packages/base) and update the certificate path accordingly.***

## Run the sample

- Run the sample **/tmp/simplesample_http**
- See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iothub] for information about the tools you can use to monitor the messages your device sends to your IoT hub and to send commands to your devices.

***Note: To send a command to the device from iothub-explorer or DeviceExplorer, the command should be like {"Name":"TurnFanOff", "Parameters":{}}***
