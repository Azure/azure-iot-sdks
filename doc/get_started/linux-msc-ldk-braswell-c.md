# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect the Braswell device running MSC-LDK with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:

-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   Braswell module and baseboard.
-   MSC-LDK (Linux Development Kit)

<a name="PrepareDevice"></a>
# Step 2: Prepare your Device
-   Follow the instructions in chapter "Getting Started" of the [devices user manual][lnk-user-manual]

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

## 3.1 Build SDK and sample

-   The Microsoft Azure IoT Device SDK for C is already installed in the standard images as the package "azure-iot-sdks-samples".

-   These images can be built after MSC-LDK installation with:

        make msc-image-sato

    or

        make msc-image-lxqt

## 3.2 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

- Open a telnet session and connect to the device.
- Run the sample by issuing following command:

    **For HTTP:**

        iothub_client_sample_http "<device connection string>"

- Replace the above placeholder "&lt;device connection string&gt;" with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Step-1:-Prerequisites) and save the changes.

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.

## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.

# Tips

- If you just want to build the serializer samples, run the following commands:

        ./build.sh bitbake -c cleanall azure-iot-sdks
        ./build.sh bitbake -c compile azure-iot-sdks
        ./build.sh bitbake -c devshell azure-iot-sdks

  and in the devshell

        ../temp/run.do_compile
