# Step 3: Build SDK and Run the sample

-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015. Open the **iothub_client_sample_http.sln** solution in the  **azureIotSDks\c\iothub_client\samples\iothub_client_sample_http\windows** folder in your local copy of the repository.

-   In Visual Studio, in **Solution Explorer**, navigate to **samples** folder.

-   In the **iothub_client_sample_http** project, open the **iothub_client_sample_http.c** file.

-   Locate the following code in the file:

        static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string you obtained in [Step 1](#Step-1:-Prerequisites) and save the changes.

-   In Visual Studio, under Solution Explorer, right-click the **iothub_client_sample_http** project, click **Debug âˆ’> Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.

-   See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application and how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
