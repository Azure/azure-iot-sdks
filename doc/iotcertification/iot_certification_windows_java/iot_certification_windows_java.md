As part of the sign up process, you will receive the connection string. 

-   **IoT Hub Connection String**: An example of IoT Hub Connection String is as below:

         HostName=[YourIoTHubName];SharedAccessKeyName=[YourAccessKeyName];SharedAccessKey=[YourAccessKey]

<a name="Step_2"/>
# Step 2: Register Device

In this section, you will register your device using DeviceExplorer. The DeviceExplorer is a Windows application that interfaces with Azure IoT Hub and can perform the following operations:

-   Device management
    -   Create new devices
    -   List existing devices and expose device properties stored on Device Hub
    -   Provides ability to update device keys
    -   Provides ability to delete a device
-   Monitoring events from your device
-   Sending messages to your device

To run DeviceExplorer tool, use following configuration string as described in
[Step1](#Step_1):

-   IoT Hub Connection String
    

**Steps:**
1.  Click [here](<https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md>) to download and install DeviceExplorer.

2.  Add connection information under the Configuration tab and click the **Update** button.

3.  Create and register the device with your IoT Hub using instructions as below.

    a. Click the **Management** tab.

    b. Your registered devices will be displayed in the list. In case your device is not there in the list, click **Refresh** button. If this is your first time, then you shouldn't retrieve anything.

    c. Click **Create** button to create a device ID and key.

    d. Once created successfully, device will be listed in DeviceExplorer.

    e. Right click the device and from context menu select "**Copy connection
    string for selected device**".

    f. Save this information in Notepad. You will need this information in
    later steps.

# Step 3: Build and Validate the sample using Java client libraries

This section walks you through building, deploying and validating the IoT Client SDK on your device running a Windows operating system. You will install the necessary prerequisites on your device. Once done, you will build and deploy the IoT Client SDK, and validate the sample tests required for IoT certification with the Azure IoT SDK.

<a name="Step_3_1"/>
## 3.1 Install Azure IoT Device SDK and prerequisites on device

-   To run the SDK you will need Java SE 1.8.

-   Install the prerequisite packages using command line on the device.

<a name="Step_3_1_1"/>
### 3.1.1  Install Java JDK 1.8 and set up environment variables
        
1.  For downloads and installation instructions go here: <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>
       
2.  Please make sure that the `PATH` environment variable includes the full path to the jdk1.8.x\bin directory. (Example: c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_65)
        
3.  Please make sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable includes the full path to the jdk1.8.x directory. (Example: JAVA_HOME=c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_65)

4.  You can test whether your PATH variable is set correctly by restarting your console and running `java -version`.

<a name="Step_3_1_2"/>
### 3.1.2  Install Maven and set up environment variables
Using Maven 3 is the recommended way to install Azure IoT device SDK for Java.

1.  For downloads and installation instructions for maven 3 go here: <https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi>

2.  Please make sure that the PATH environment variable includes the full path to the apache-maven-3.x.x\bin directory. (Example: F:\Setups\apache-maven-3.3.3\bin). The apache-maven-3.x.x directory is where Maven 3 is installed.

2.  You can verify that the environment variables necessary to run Maven 3 have been set correctly by restarting your console and running `mvn --version.`
  
<a name="Step_3_1_3"/>
### 3.1.3  Install GIT

-   For downloads and installation instructions go here:
<http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>

<a name="Step_3_1_4"/>
### 3.1.4  Build Qpid JMS

1.  Clone the repository for Qpid JMS to your local directory.
    
        git clone https://github.com/avranju/qpid-jms.git

2.  Install Qpid JMS by executing following commands in sequence:

        cd qpid-jms
        mvn install
        cd ..

    ***Note:*** *We have noticed that certain unit tests can fail when running  `mvn install` as given above with the latest version of JDK 8 (1.8.0_65 at the time this document was written). It works fine with older versions however. If this occurs please skip running unit tests using following command:*
    
        mvn install -DskipTests

<a name="Step_3_1_5"/>
### 3.1.5 Build the Azure IoT Device SDK for Java

1.  Download the SDK to the board by issuing the following command in PuTTY:

        git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks.git

2.  Verify that you now have a copy of the source code under the directory **azure-iot-sdks**.

3.  Run the following commands on device in sequence to build Azure IoT SDK.

        cd azure-iot-sdks/java/device
        mvn install

4.  Above command will generate the compiled JAR files with all dependencies. This bundle can be found at:

        azure-iot-sdks/java/device/iothub-java-client/target/iothub-java-client-{version}-with-deps.jar

<a name="Step_3_2"/>
## 3.2 Run and Validate the Samples

In this section you will run the Azure IoT client SDK samples to validate
communication between your device and Azure IoT Hub. You will send messages to the Azure IoT Hub service and validate that IoT Hub has successfully receive the data. You will also monitor any messages sent from the Azure IoT Hub to client.

***Note:*** *Take screenshots of all the operations you will perform in this
section. These will be needed in [Step 4](#Step_4_2).*
