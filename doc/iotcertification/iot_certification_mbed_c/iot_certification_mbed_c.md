# Step 3: Build and Validate the sample using C client libraries

This section walks you through building, deploying and validating the IoT Client SDK on your device running a mbed operating system. You will install necessary prerequisites on your device.  Once done,  you will build and deploy the IoT Client SDK and validate the sample tests required for IoT certification with the Azure IoT SDK.

<a name="Step-3-1:-Load"/>
## 3.1 Connect the Device

1.  Connect the board to your network using an Ethernet cable. This step
    is required, as the sample depends on internet access.

2.  Plug the device into your computer using a micro-USB cable.

3.  Install the Windows serial port drivers located
    [here](http://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration#1-download-the-mbed-windows-serial-port).

4.  Install the 7-Zip software from [here](http://www.7-zip.org).

<a name="Step-3-2:-Build"/>
## 3.2  Build the samples

1. Clone [GitHub
    SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks.git) repository
    to your machine.

2.  Browse to the folder

        /azure-iot-sdks/c/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_sample_amqp/mbed

3.  Run the **mkmbedzip.bat** file. This will generate
    **iothub\_client\_sample\_amqp.zip** file in the same folder.

      ***NOTE:*** *When the zip file is uploaded to the compiler web page, the browser will keep the zip file open. Attempting to create another zip while your browsers are open will fail.*

4.  In your web browser, go to the [mbed developer's
    site](https://developer.mbed.org/). If you haven't signed up, you
    will see an option to create a new account (it's free). Otherwise,
    log in with your account credentials.

5.  Click on **Compiler** in the upper right-hand corner of the page.
    This should bring you to the **Workspace Management** interface.

6.  Make sure the hardware platform you're using appears in the upper

## 3.3 Run and Validate the samples

In this section you will run the Azure IoT client SDK samples to validate
communication between your device and Azure IoT Hub. You will send messages to the Azure IoT Hub service and validate that IoT Hub has successfully receive the data. You will also monitor any messages send from the Azure IoT Hub to client.

***Note:*** *Take screenshots of all the operations you will perform in this
section. These will be needed in [Step 4](#Step-4-2:-Share).*

### 3.3.1 Send Device Events to IOT Hub

1.  Launch the Device Explorer as explained in [Step 2](#Step-2:-Register) and navigate to **Data** tab. Select the device name you created from the drop-down list of device IDs and click **Monitor** button.

     ![DeviceExplorer\_Monitor](images/3_3_1_01.png)

2.  Device Explorer is now monitoring data sent from the selected device to the IoT Hub.

3.  Copy the .bin file generated in last step to the device.

    ***Note:*** *Saving the .bin file to the device causes the current terminal session to the device to reset. When it reconnects, reset the terminal again manually, or start a new terminal. This enables the mbed device to reset and start executing the program.*

4.  Connect to the device using an SSH terminal program, such as PuTTY. You can determine which serial port your device uses by checking the Windows Device Manager.

    ![Windows\_SerialPort](images/3_3_1_02.png)

5.  In PuTTY, click the **Serial** connection type. The device most
    likely connects at 115200, so enter that value in the Speed box.
    Then click Open.
