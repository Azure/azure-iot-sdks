# Step 3: Build and validate the sample using Node JS client libraries

This section walks you through building, deploying and validating the IoT Client SDK on your device running a Linux operating system. You will install necessary prerequisites on your device.  Once done,  you will build and deploy the IoT Client SDK and validate the sample tests required for IoT certification with the Azure IoT SDK.

<a name="Step-3-1:-Load"/>
## 3.1 Load the Azure IoT bits and prerequisites on device

-   Open a PuTTY session and connect to the device.

-   Choose your commands in next steps based on the OS running on your device.

-   Run following command to check if NodeJS is already installed

        node --version

    If version is **0.12.x or greater**, then skip next step of installing prerequisite packages. Else uninstall it by issuing following command from command line on the device.

    **Debian or Ubuntu**

        sudo apt-get remove nodejs

    **Fedora**

        sudo dnf remove nodejs

    **Any Other Linux OS**

        Use equivalent commands on the target OS

-   Install the prerequisite packages by issuing the following commands from the command line on the device. Choose your commands based on the OS running on your device.

    **Debian or Ubuntu**

        curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo bash -

        sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

    **Fedora**

        wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v4.2.1/node-v4.2.1-linux-x64.tar.gz

        tar xvf node-v4.2.1-linux-x64.tar.gz

        sudo mv node-v4.2.1-linux-x64 /opt

        echo "export PATH=\$PATH:/opt/node-v4.2.1-linux-x64/bin" >> ~/.bashrc

        source ~/.bashrc

    **Any Other Linux OS**

        Use equivalent commands on the target OS

    **Note:** To test successful installation of Node JS, try to fetch its version information by running following command:

        node --version

-   Download the SDK to the board by issuing the following command in
    PuTTY:

        git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks.git

-   Verify that you now have a copy of the source code under the directory ~/azure-iot-sdks.

<a name="Step-3-2:-Build"/>
## 3.2 Build the samples

-   To validate the source code run the following commands on the device.

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdks/node
        build/dev-setup.sh
        build/build.sh | tee LogFile.txt

    ***Note:*** *LogFile.txt in above command should be replaced with a file name where build output will be written.*

-   To update samples run the following command on device.

    **For simple_sample_http.js:**

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdks/node/device/samples
        nano simple_sample_http.js

    **For send_batch_http.js:**

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdks/node/device/samples
        nano send_batch_http.js

-   This launches a console-based text editor. Scroll down to the
    connection information.

-   Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        var connectionString = "[IoT Device Connection String]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with device connection string. You can get this from device explorer as explained in [Step 2](#Step-2:-Register), that you copied into Notepad.

-   Save your changes by pressing Ctrl+O and when nano prompts you to save it as the same file, just press ENTER.

-   Press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

-   Run the following command before leaving the **~/azure-iot-sdks/node/device/samples** directory

        npm link azure-iot-device

    **For registry_sample.js:**

        cd ~/azure-iot-sdks/node/service/samples
        nano registry_sample.js

-   This launches a console-based text editor. Scroll down to the
    connection information.

-   Find the following place holder for IoT connection string:

        var connectionString = "[IoT Connection String]";

-   Replace the above placeholder with "IoT Hub Connection String" which you used        in  [Step 2](#Step-2:-Register) for device registration.

-   Save your changes by pressing Ctrl+O and when nano prompts you to save it as the same file, just press ENTER.

-   Press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

-   Run the following command before leaving the **~/azure-iot-sdks/node/service/samples** directory

        npm link azure-iothub

## 3.3 Run and Validate the Samples

In this section you will run the Azure IoT client SDK samples to validate communication between your device and Azure IoT Hub service. You will send messages to the Azure IoT Hub service and validate that IoT Hub has successfully receive the data. You will also monitor any messages send from the Azure IoT Hub to client.

**Note:** Take screen shots of all operations, like sample screen shots, performed in below sections. These will be needed in [Step 4](#Step-4-2:-Share)

### 3.3.1 Send Device Events to IOT Hub:

1.  Launch the Device Explorer as explained in [Step 2](#Step-2:-Register) and navigate to **Data** tab. Select the device name you created from the drop-down list of device IDs, click **Monitor** button.
