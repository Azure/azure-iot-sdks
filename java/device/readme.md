# Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for Java

The Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for Java facilitates building devices and applications that connect and are managed by Azure IoT Suite services.

The device library consists of a set of reusable components with abstract interfaces that enable pluggability between stock and custom modules.

## Features

 * Sends event data to Azure IoT based services.
 * Receives messages from Azure IoT Hub.
 * Maps server commands to device functions.
 * Buffers data when network connection is down.
 * Batches messages to improve communication efficiency.
 * Supports pluggable transport protocols. HTTPS and AMQP protocols are available now, with more coming soon.
