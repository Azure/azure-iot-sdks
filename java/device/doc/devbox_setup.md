## Install Java JDK SE
To run the SDK you will need **Java SE 1.7** if running on Windows or **Java SE 1.8+** if running on Linux.

### Windows
For downloads and installation instructions go here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

#### Set up environment variables
- Please make sure that the `PATH` environment variable includes the full path to the `jdk1.7.x\bin` directory. (Example: C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_79\\bin)
- Please make sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable includes the full path to the `jdk1.7.x` directory. (Example: JAVA_HOME=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_79)

You can test whether your `PATH` variable is set correctly by restarting your console and running `java -version`.

### Linux
On Linux, Java JDK 1.8 can be installed as follows:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
```

**If you are running a version of Ubuntu below 14.10, you will need to run the below command to add the respository containing openjdk-8-jdk to Ubuntu's list of software sources before attempting to use apt-get to install openjdk-8-jdk:**

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa
```

#### Set up environment variables
- Please make sure that the `PATH` environment variable includes the full path to the bin folder containing java.

	```
	which java
	echo $PATH
	```
	Ensure that the bin directory shown by the ```which java``` command matches one of the directories shown in your $PATH variable.
	If it does not:
	```
	export PATH=/path/to/java/bin:$PATH
	```

- Please make sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable includes the full path to the jdk.

	```
	update-alternatives --config java
	```
	Take note of the jdk location. ```update-alternatives``` will show something similar to ***/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java***. The jdk directory would then be ***/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/***.

	```
	export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk
	```

## Install Maven
Using **_Maven 3_** is the recommended way to install **Azure IoT device SDK for Java**.

### Windows
For downloads and installation instructions go here: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

#### Set up environment variables
- Please make sure that the `PATH` environment variable includes the full path to the `apache-maven-3.x.x\bin` directory. (Example: F:\\Setups\\apache-maven-3.3.3\\bin). The `apache-maven-3.x.x` directory is where Maven 3 is installed.

You can verify that the environment variables necessary to run **_Maven 3_** have been set correctly by restarting your console and running `mvn --version`.

### Linux
On Linux, Maven 3 can be installed as follows:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install maven
```

#### Set up environment variables

Please verify the following:

- `PATH` environment variable contain the full path to the bin folder containing **_Maven 3_**.

	```
	which mvn
	echo $PATH
	```
	Ensure that the bin directory shown by the ```which mvn``` command matches one of the directories shown in your $PATH variable.
	If it does not:
	```
	export PATH=/path/to/mvn/bin:$PATH
	```

You can verify that the environment variables necessary to run **_Maven 3_** have been set correctly by running `mvn --version`.

## Install Qpid JMS
```
git clone https://github.com/avranju/qpid-jms.git
cd qpid-jms
mvn install
```

We have noticed that certain unit tests can fail when running `mvn install` as given above with the latest version of JDK 8 (1.8.0_60 at the time this document was written). It works fine with older versions however. If this occurs please skip running unit tests like so:

```
mvn install -DskipTests
```

## Install Azure IoT device SDK for Java

- Get a copy of the **Azure IoT device SDK** from GitHub. You should fetch a copy of the source from the **master** branch of the GitHub repository: <https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks>

- When you have obtained a copy of the source, you can build the SDK for Java.

Open a command prompt and use the following commands for the steps above:

```
	git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks.git
	cd azure-iot-sdks/java/device
	mvn install
```

The compiled JAR file with all dependencies bundled in can then be found at:

```
{IoT device SDK root}/java/device/iothub-java-client/target/iothub-java-client-{version}-with-deps.jar
```

When you're ready to use the Java SDK in your own project, include this JAR file in your project to use the IoT device SDK.

_In the future, the IoT device SDK for Java will be uploaded to the Maven central repository.
Then, it can be included as a dependency in your project by including the following block
in your pom.xml file:_

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.azure.iothub-java-client</groupId>
    <artifactId>iothub-java-client</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```
