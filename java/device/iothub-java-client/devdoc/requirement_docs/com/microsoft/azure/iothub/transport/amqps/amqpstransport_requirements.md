# AmqpsTransport Requirements
â€ƒ
## Overview

An AMQPS transport. Contains functionality for adding messages and sending messages to an IoT Hub. Buffers unsent messages until they are received by an IoT Hub. A transport is bound at construction to the following parameters: IoT Hub name, device ID and device key. The transport also receives messages from IoT Hub and invokes a user-defined message callback if a message and callback are found.

### AmqpsTransport

```java
public AmqpsTransport(DeviceClientConfig config, Boolean useWebSockets);
```

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_001: [**The constructor shall save the input parameters into instance variables.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_002: [**The constructor shall set the transport state to CLOSED.**]**


### open

```java
public void open() throws IOException;
```

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_003: [**If an AMQPS connection is already open, the function shall do nothing.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_004: [**The function shall open an AMQPS connection with the IoT Hub given in the configuration.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_005: [**The function shall add the transport to the list of listeners subscribed to the connection events.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_006: [**If the connection was opened successfully, the transport state shall be set to OPEN.**]**


### close

```java
public void close() throws IOException;
```

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_007: [**If the AMQPS connection is closed, the function shall do nothing.**]*

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_008: [**The function shall close an AMQPS connection with the IoT Hub given in the configuration.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_009: [**The function shall set the transport state to CLOSED.**]**


### addMessage

```java
public void addMessage(Message msg, IotHubEventCallback callback, Object callbackContext);
```

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_010: [**If the AMQPS session is closed, the function shall throw an IllegalStateException.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_011: [**The function shall add a packet containing the message, callback, and callback context to the queue of messages waiting to be sent.**]**


### sendMessages

```java
public void sendMessages() throws IOException;
```

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_012: [**If the AMQPS session is closed, the function shall throw an IllegalStateException.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_013: [**If there are no messages in the waiting list, the function shall return.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_014: [**The function shall attempt to send every message on its waiting list, one at a time.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_015: [**The function shall skip messages with null or empty body.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_016: [**If the sent message hash is valid, it is added to the in progress map.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_017: [**If the sent message hash is not valid, it is buffered to be sent in a subsequent attempt.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_036: [**The function shall create a new Proton message from the IoTHub message.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_038: [**The function shall add all user properties to the application properties of the Proton message.**]**

### invokeCallbacks

```java
public void invokeCallbacks() throws IllegalStateException;
```

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_019: [**If the transport is closed, the function shall throw an IllegalStateException.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_020: [**The function shall invoke all the callbacks from the callback queue.**]**


### handleMessage

```java
public void handleMessage() throws IOException;
```

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_021: [**If the transport is closed, the function shall throw an IllegalStateException.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_024: [**If no message was received from IotHub, the function shall return.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_025: [**If no callback is defined, the list of received messages is cleared.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_026: [**The function shall invoke the callback on the message.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_027: [**The function shall return the message result (one of COMPLETE, ABANDON, or REJECT) to the IoT Hub.**]**

**SRS_AMQPSTRANSPORT_15_028: [**If the result could not be sent to IoTHub, the message shall be put back in the received messages queue to be processed again.**]**


### messageSent

```java
public synchronized void messageSent(Integer messageHash, Boolean deliveryState)
