# Getting started - running a C sample application on Windows

This "Getting Started" document shows you how to build and run the **simplesample_amqp** application on the Windows platform.

## Requirements

These instructions assume that you have done the following:

- [Prepare your development environment][devbox-setup]

## Before you begin
Before you begin you will need to create and configure an IoT hub to connect to.
  1. [Set up your IoT Hub][setup-iothub].
  1. With your IoT hub configured and running in Azure, follow the instructions in [Connecting your device to an IoT hub][provision-device].
  1. Make note of the Connection String for your device from the previous step.

  > Note: You can skip this step if you just want to build the sample application without running it.

## Build and run the sample

1. Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015. Open the **azure_iot_sdks.sln** solution in the **cmake** folder in your home directory.

2. In Visual Studio, in **Solution Explorer**, navigate to **simplesample_amqp** project, open the **simplesample_amqp.c** file.

3. Locate the following code in the file:

    ```
   static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";
    ```

4. Replace "[device connection string]" with the device connection string you noted [earlier](#beforebegin) and save the changes:

  ```
  static const char* connectionString = "HostName=..."
  ```

5. The section "Send events" in the document [How to use Device Explorer](../../tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) describes how to prepare the **DeviceExplorer** tool to receive device-to-cloud messages from the sample application.

6. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **simplesample_amqp** project, click **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.

7. Use the **DeviceExplorer** utility to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the **simplesample_amqp** application.

8. See "Monitor device-to-cloud events" in the document [How to use Device Explorer][device-explorer] to learn how to use the **DeviceExplorer** utility to send cloud-to-device messages to the **simplesample_amqp** application.
