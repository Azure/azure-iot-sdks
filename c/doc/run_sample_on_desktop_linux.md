# Getting started - running a C sample application on desktop Linux

This "Getting Started" document shows you how to build and run the **simplesample_amqp** application on a desktop Linux platform.

## Requirements

These instructions assume that you have done the following:

- [Prepare your development environment][setup-devbox-linux]

## Before you begin
Before you begin you will need to create and configure an IoT hub to connect to.
  1. [Set up your IoT Hub][setup-iothub].
  1. With your IoT hub configured and running in Azure, follow the instructions in [Connecting your device to an IoT hub][provision-device].
  1. Make note of the Connection String for your device from the previous step.

  > Note: You can skip this step if you just want to build the sample application without running it.

## Build and run the sample

1. Open the file **c/serializer/samples/simplesample_amqp/simplesample_amqp.c** in a text editor.

2. Locate the following code in the file:
    ```
   static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";
    ```
3. Replace "[device connection string]" with the device connection string you noted [earlier](#beforebegin). Save the changes.

4. The section "Send events" in the document [How to use Device Explorer](../../tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) describes how to prepare the **DeviceExplorer** tool to receive device-to-cloud messages from the sample application.

5. Save your changes and build the samples.  To build your sample you can run the the build.sh script in the **c/build_all/linux** directory. To skip running the unit tests, use:

  ```
  ./build.sh --skip-unit-tests
  ```

6. Run the **~/cmake/serializer/samples/simplesample_amqp/linux/simplesample_amqp** sample application.

7. Use the **DeviceExplorer** utility to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the **simplesample_amqp** application.

8. See "Send cloud-to-device messages" in the document [How to use Device Explorer for IoT Hub devices][device-explorer] for instructions on sending messages with the **DeviceExplorer** utility.
