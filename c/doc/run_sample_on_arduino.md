## Requirements

  - Computer with a Git client installed so that you can access the azure-iot-sdks code on GitHub.
  - Arduino Yun board.
  - Debian x86

<a name="beforebegin"/>
## Before you begin

Before you begin you will need to create and configure an IoT hub to connect to.

  1. [Set up your IoT Hub][setup-iothub].
  2. With your IoT hub configured and running in Azure, follow the instructions in [Connecting your device to an IoT hub][provision-device].
  3. Make note of the Connection String for your device from the previous step.

Note: You can skip this step if you just want to build the sample application without running it.

## Setup the development environment

This section shows you how to set up a development environment for the Azure IoT device SDK for C on Arduino Yun.

Install dependencies under root/sudo. 

``` 
apt-get install curl libcurl4-openssl-dev uuid-dev uuid g++ make cmake git unzip openjdk-7-jre libssl-dev libncurses-dev subversion
```

1. Clone this repository ([azure-iot-sdks](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks)) to the machine you are using.
2. Open a shell and navigate to the folder **c/build_all/arduino** in your local copy of the repository.
3. Run the `setup.sh` script to install the OpenWRT SDK and prerequisites. By default, the SDK will be installed at **~/openwrt/sdk**
4. (Optional) Enter 'Y' to build the Azure IoT SDK.

This script builds the **iothub_client** and **serializer** libraries and their associated samples.

Note: you will not be able to run the samples until you configure them with a valid IoT Hub device connection string. For more information, see [Run sample on Linux](run_sample_on_desktop_linux.md).

 <a name="build"/>
## Build the sample

1. Open the file **c/serializer/samples/simplesample_http/simplesample_http.c** in a text editor.
2. Locate the following code in the file:
   ```
   static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";
   ```
3. Replace "[device connection string]" with the device connection string you noted [earlier](#beforebegin). Save the changes.
4. The section "Send events" in the document [How to use Device Explorer](../../tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) describes how to prepare the **DeviceExplorer** tool to receive device-to-cloud messages from the sample application.
5. Run the `build.sh` script in the **c/build_all/arduino** directory.   

<a name="deploy"/>
## Deploy the sample

1. Open a shell and navigate to the installed OpenWRT SDK folder. By default, it is **~/openwrt/sdk**.
2. Transfer the package.

OpenWRT Yun Image:

```
scp bin/ar71xx/packages/azure-iot-sdks_1-1_ar71xx.ipk root@arduino.local:/tmp
```

LininoIO Yun Image:

```
scp bin/ar71xx/packages/azure-iot-sdks_1-1_ar71xx.ipk root@linino.local:/tmp
```

<a name="run"/>
## Run the sample

The following instructions assumes the device is flashed with OpenWRT Yun. If you are using LininoIO, substitute `arduino` with `linino` and use the default password `doghunter`.

1. Open shell and enter `ssh root@arduino.local` Enter the device password. By default it is, `arduino` for OpenWRT Yun Image or `doghunter` for LininoIO.
2. Install the package.

```
opkg install /tmp/azure-iot-sdks_1-1_ar71xx.ipk
```

3. Navigate to /usr/share/azure-iot-sdk/samples
4. run **./simplesample_http**
5. Use the **DeviceExplorer** utility to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the **simplesample_http** application.
7. See "Send cloud-to-device messages" in the document [How to use Device Explorer for IoT Hub devices][device-explorer] for instructions on sending messages with the **DeviceExplorer** utility.
