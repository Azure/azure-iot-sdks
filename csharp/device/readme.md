# Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for .NET

The Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for .NET facilitates building devices and applications that connect to and are managed by Azure IoT Hub services.

The library is available as a NuGet package for you include in your own development projects. This repository contains documentation and samples to help you get started using this SDK.

## Features

 * Sends event data to Azure IoT based services.
 * Maps server commands to device functions.
 * Batches messages to improve communication efficiency.
 * Supports pluggable transport protocols.

Note the library Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client supports both HTTPS and AMQP protocols. The Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client.WinRT library currently supports HTTPS at this time.
