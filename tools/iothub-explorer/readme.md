#iothub-explorer
A sample CLI tool to manage device clients using the Azure IoT Hub service SDK. The tool enables you to manage the devices in the identity register, monitor device-to-cloud messages, and send cloud-to-device commands.

<a name="identityregistry"/>
## Working with the device identity registry

Supply your IoT Hub connection string once using the **login** command. This means you do not need to supply the connection string for subsequent commands for the duration of the session (defaults to one hour):

```shell
$ iothub-explorer login "HostName=<my-hub>.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=<my-policy>;SharedAccessKey=<my-policy-key>"

Session started, expires Fri Jan 15 2016 17:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)
```

> Note: See [Set up IoT Hub](../../doc/setup_iothub.md) for information about how to retrieve your IoT Hub connection string.

To retrieve information about an already-registered device from the device identity registry in your IoT Hub, including the device connection string, use the following command:

```shell
$ iothub-explorer get known-device --connection-string

-
  deviceId:                   known-device
  ...
-
  connectionString: HostName=<my-hub>.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=known-device;SharedAccessKey=<known-device-key>
```

To register a new device and get its connection string from the device identity registry in your IoT Hub, use the following command:

```shell
$ iothub-explorer create new-device --connection-string

Created device new-device

-
  deviceId:                   new-device
  ...
-
  connectionString: HostName=<my-hub>.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=new-device;SharedAccessKey=<new-device-key>
```

To delete a device from the device identity registry in your IoT Hub, use the following command:

```shell
$ iothub-explorer delete existing-device
```

<a name="devices"/>
## Working with devices

Use the following command to monitor the device-to-cloud messages from a device:

```shell
$ iothub-explorer 'HostName=<my-hub>.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=<my-policy>;SharedAccessKey=<my-policy-key>' monitor-events myFirstDevice              

Monitoring events from device myFirstDevice

Listening on endpoint iothub-ehub-<my-endpoint>/ConsumerGroups/$Default/Partitions/1 start time: 1453821103646

Event received:

Event received: 
{ deviceId: 'myFirstDevice', windSpeed: 11.123057782649994 }
```

> Note: The **monitor-events** command requires you to provide the IoT Hub connection string even if you have created a session using the **login** command.

Use the following commands to send a cloud-to-device command and then wait for the device to respond with an acknowledgment:

```shell
$ iothub-explorer send myFirstDevice MyMessage --ack=full

Message sent (id: 13bc1852-eeb4-4611-b0bd-329d80c83f6f)

$ iothub-explorer receive myFirstDevice
